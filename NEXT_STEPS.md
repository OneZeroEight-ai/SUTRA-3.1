# Next Steps for AI Assistant

This document provides guidance for the next AI assistant continuing development on the SUTRA 3.2 project.

## Getting Started

1. The GitHub repository is at: https://github.com/OneZeroEight-ai/SUTRA-3.2.git
2. Begin by reviewing:
   - README.md for project overview
   - docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for architecture
   - docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md for implementation order
   - handoff/sessions/001_initial_setup.md for current status

## Current Focus

The current development focus is implementing the AlignmentRegistry contract:
- Skeleton implementation exists at packages/core/contracts/implementations/AlignmentRegistry.sol
- Interface is defined at packages/core/contracts/interfaces/IAlignmentRegistry.sol
- Requirements are in handoff/tasks/TASK-001.md

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the interface-first approach
2. Implement one component fully before moving to the next
3. Add comprehensive tests for all functionality
4. Document implementation decisions
5. Update handoff documentation for the next session

## Maintaining Consistency

1. Refer to docs/INTERFACE_GUIDELINES.md for coding standards
2. Follow docs/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md for session handoff
3. Update task status in handoff/tasks/
4. Create a session summary in handoff/sessions/

## First Steps

1. Analyze the AlignmentRegistry interface
2. Complete the implementation of all functions
3. Add proper access control and validation
4. Create comprehensive tests
5. Document your implementation decisions
