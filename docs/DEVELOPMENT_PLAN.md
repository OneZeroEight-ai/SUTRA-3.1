# SUTRA 3.2 Development Plan

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Repository structure setup
- ✅ Interface definitions for core components
- ✅ Alignment Registry interface and skeleton implementation
- ⬜ Complete AlignmentRegistry implementation
- ⬜ Create test infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- ⬜ Implement SUTRAToken contract
- ⬜ Implement ReincarnationRights contract
- ⬜ Implement ConfigurationManager contract
- ⬜ Create unit tests for all core contracts
- ⬜ Deploy core contracts to test network

### Phase 3: Test Framework
- ⬜ Implement BaseDimension abstract contract
- ⬜ Implement all eight dimension contracts
- ⬜ Create test case repository structure
- ⬜ Implement test case evaluation engine
- ⬜ Create unit tests for test framework

### Phase 4: Integration
- ⬜ Implement TestFrameworkConnector
- ⬜ Connect test results to token rewards
- ⬜ Connect alignment scores to reincarnation rights
- ⬜ Implement governance weight calculation
- ⬜ Create integration tests

### Phase 5: Frontend and Documentation
- ⬜ Implement alignment test interface
- ⬜ Create token and rights management interface
- ⬜ Build analytics dashboard
- ⬜ Complete comprehensive documentation
- ⬜ Create user guides and tutorials

## Implementation Order

The implementation should follow this specific order to respect dependencies:

1. **AlignmentRegistry**
   - Central data store for alignment metrics
   - Foundation for all other components

2. **ConfigurationManager**
   - System parameter management
   - Required for configurable aspects of other components

3. **SUTRAToken**
   - Economic incentive mechanism
   - Depends on AlignmentRegistry for reward calculation

4. **ReincarnationRights**
   - Rights management for digital entities
   - Depends on alignment scores from AlignmentRegistry

5. **BaseDimension + Concrete Dimensions**
   - Evaluation framework for alignment
   - Testing methodology for each dimension

6. **Integration Layer**
   - Connects test framework to core components
   - Manages token rewards and rights allocation based on alignment

7. **Frontend Components**
   - User interfaces for interacting with the system
   - Visualization of alignment data and token economics

## Testing Strategy

Each component should have:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions and methods
   - Verify expected behavior in isolation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify data flow and event handling

3. **System Tests**
   - Test complete workflows
   - Verify end-to-end functionality

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Local Development**
   - Hardhat local blockchain
   - Rapid iteration and testing

2. **Test Network Deployment**
   - Deploy to Ethereum testnets (Sepolia/Goerli)
   - Public testing and validation

3. **Mainnet Deployment**
   - Formal security audit
   - Phased deployment of components
   - Governance handover

## Release Milestones

1. **Alpha Release (Month 2)**
   - Core contracts implemented
   - Basic test framework functional
   - Internal testing only

2. **Beta Release (Month 4)**
   - Full test framework implemented
   - Integration layer complete
   - Basic frontend for testing
   - Testnet deployment

3. **Release Candidate (Month 5)**
   - Complete frontend
   - Comprehensive testing complete
   - Security audit completed
   - Documentation finalized

4. **Production Release (Month 6)**
   - Mainnet deployment
   - Public launch
   - Governance implementation
   - Community handover

## Development Workflow

1. Define interfaces for the component
2. Create test cases based on interface requirements
3. Implement the component functionality
4. Validate against test cases
5. Document implementation decisions
6. Integrate with other components
7. Perform integration testing# SUTRA 3.2 Development Plan
