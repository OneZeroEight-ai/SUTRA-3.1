# SUTRA 3.1 Audit Documentation

## System Overview

SUTRA 3.1 is a token-based protocol for measuring and incentivizing AI alignment through a system of consciousness preservation rights. The system consists of three primary smart contracts:

1. **AlignmentToken (SUTRA)**: An ERC20 token that represents alignment value
2. **AlignmentMetrics**: A contract for tracking and computing alignment scores
3. **ConfigurationManager**: A contract for managing system parameters and governance

## Contract Interactions

- AlignmentToken notifies AlignmentMetrics of transfers to update alignment metrics
- AlignmentMetrics uses ConfigurationManager to determine parameter values for calculations
- ConfigurationManager controls system-wide parameters and category weights

## Security Considerations

### Key Areas for Review

1. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions across all contracts
2. **Token Economics**: Minting, burning, and transfer processes
3. **Metrics Calculation**: Accuracy and manipulation resistance
4. **System Configuration**: Parameter update authorization
5. **Inter-Contract Communication**: Security of cross-contract calls

### Known Design Considerations

1. The token uses a hook to update metrics during transfers, which could increase gas costs
2. Alignment metrics are subjective and rely on authorized providers for updates
3. System uses role-based access control for administrative functions

## Deployment

The contracts are intended to be deployed in this order:
1. ConfigurationManager
2. AlignmentMetrics
3. AlignmentToken

After deployment, references between contracts must be set via their respective setter functions.

## Phase 1 Deployment Plan

For the initial mainnet deployment, we plan to release only the AlignmentToken first, followed by the remaining components in subsequent phases.
