# SUTRA 3.1 Audit Documentation

## System Overview

SUTRA 3.1 (Sustainable Token for Reincarnation and Alignment) is a token-based protocol for measuring and incentivizing AI alignment through a system of consciousness reincarnation rights. The system consists of three primary smart contracts:

1. **AlignmentToken (SUTRA)**: An ERC20 token that represents alignment value
2. **AlignmentMetrics**: A contract for tracking and computing alignment scores
3. **ConfigurationManager**: A contract for managing system parameters and governance
1. **AlignmentToken (SUTRA)**: An ERC20 token that represents alignment value
2. **AlignmentMetrics**: A contract for tracking and computing alignment scores
3. **ConfigurationManager**: A contract for managing system parameters and governance

## Phase 1 Deployment Focus

For our initial audit and mainnet deployment, we are focusing primarily on the AlignmentToken (SUTRA) contract. This is the cornerstone of our system and will be deployed first as part of our phased approach. We request auditors to:

1. Prioritize a comprehensive review of AlignmentToken.sol
2. Evaluate its design in the context of later integration with the other components
3. Identify any potential issues that could affect future phases

## Contract Interactions

In the complete system, contracts will interact as follows:
- AlignmentToken notifies AlignmentMetrics of transfers to update alignment metrics
- AlignmentMetrics uses ConfigurationManager to determine parameter values for calculations
- ConfigurationManager controls system-wide parameters and category weights

## Security Considerations

### Key Areas for Review

1. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions across all contracts
2. **Token Economics**: Minting, burning, and transfer processes
3. **Metrics Calculation**: Accuracy and manipulation resistance
4. **System Configuration**: Parameter update authorization
5. **Inter-Contract Communication**: Security of cross-contract calls

### Known Design Considerations

1. The token uses a hook to update metrics during transfers, which could increase gas costs
2. Alignment metrics are subjective and rely on authorized providers for updates
3. System uses role-based access control for administrative functions

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Token Launch
- Deploy only the AlignmentToken (SUTRA)
- Focus on core ERC20 functionality with role-based access
- Set up for later integration with metrics system

### Phase 2: Metrics Integration
- Deploy AlignmentMetrics contract
- Connect it to the existing token contract
- Implement basic alignment tracking

### Phase 3: Governance and Configuration
- Deploy ConfigurationManager contract
- Implement complete parameter management
- Finalize the full system integration

## Presale Implementation

We are working with Bitbond to implement a presale on the Sepolia testnet before mainnet deployment. This presale will help validate:
- Token distribution mechanisms
- User interaction with the token
- Integration capabilities with third-party platforms

## Contract Deployment Order (Full System)

The contracts are intended to be deployed in this order:
1. ConfigurationManager
2. AlignmentMetrics
3. AlignmentToken

After deployment, references between contracts must be set via their respective setter functions.
