# Task: Implement AlignmentRegistry Contract

**ID:** TASK-001
**Created:** 2025-02-27
**Last Updated:** 2025-02-27
**Status:** NOT_STARTED
**Priority:** HIGH
**Component:** CORE

## Description

Complete the implementation of the AlignmentRegistry contract, which is the central storage for alignment metrics in the SUTRA 3.2 system. The skeleton implementation is already created, but all methods need to be fully implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement registerEntity function with proper access control
- [ ] Implement updateScore function with validation
- [ ] Implement updateMultipleScores function
- [ ] Implement getScore and getAggregateScore functions
- [ ] Implement getAllScores function
- [ ] Implement isEntityRegistered function
- [ ] Implement getLastUpdateTimestamp and getLastEvaluator functions
- [ ] Implement _calculateAggregateScore internal function
- [ ] Add proper events for all state changes
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Include NatSpec documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for all functions

## Dependencies

- Repository setup (COMPLETED)
- Interface definitions (COMPLETED)

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement access control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
2. Add validation for all inputs using the internal helper functions
3. Implement the registration logic with proper event emission
4. Implement score update logic with validation and event emission
5. Implement the score aggregation logic using dimension weights
6. Add view functions for retrieving entity data
7. Write comprehensive tests for all scenarios

## Technical Notes

- Use the _isValidDimension and _isValidScore helper methods for validation
- Ensure the dimension weights sum to 100
- Use the Pausable functionality for emergency situations
- Store timestamps for all updates to track history
- Use AccessControl for role-based permissions

## Files to Modify

`
packages/core/contracts/implementations/AlignmentRegistry.sol - Complete implementation
packages/core/test/AlignmentRegistry.test.js - Create test file
`

## Testing Strategy

- Test all functions with both valid and invalid inputs
- Test role-based access control for all restricted functions
- Test the aggregate score calculation with various dimension scores
- Test edge cases such as:
  - Updating scores for unregistered entities
  - Updating with invalid dimension indices
  - Updating with invalid score values

## Progress Updates

### Update 2025-02-27 - SESSION-001

Task created and defined. AlignmentRegistry skeleton implementation is in place.

## Handoff Notes

This is a high-priority task as the AlignmentRegistry is the foundation for tracking alignment metrics. The implementation should focus on correctness and security first, then optimization. Dimension weights should be configurable but should always sum to 100.
