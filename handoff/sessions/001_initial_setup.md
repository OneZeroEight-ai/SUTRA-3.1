# Session Summary: SUTRA 3.2 Initial Repository Setup

**Date:** 2025-02-27
**Session ID:** 001
**Participants:** AI Assistant, Developer

## Session Goal

Create the initial repository structure for SUTRA 3.2 with comprehensive documentation to ensure consistent development across AI assistant sessions.

## Key Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure** - Organized the project as a monorepo with separate packages for core, test framework, integration, and frontend
2. **Eight-Dimensional Test Framework** - Framework will implement all eight dimensions from the alignment test consideration document
3. **Interface-First Development** - Established clear interfaces before implementations
4. **Handoff Protocol** - Created a structured handoff process for consistent development

## Progress Summary

### Completed Work

- Created repository structure with packages for core, test framework, integration, and frontend
- Established handoff documentation and templates
- Created interface definitions for core components
- Implemented AlignmentRegistry interface and skeleton
- Set up comprehensive project documentation

### Current State

The repository has the foundation required for development with interface definitions and skeleton implementations. The next step is to complete implementations of core components.

### Code Changes

`
packages/core/contracts/interfaces/IAlignmentRegistry.sol - Created AlignmentRegistry interface
packages/core/contracts/implementations/AlignmentRegistry.sol - Created skeleton implementation
packages/core/contracts/interfaces/ISUTRAToken.sol - Created SUTRAToken interface
packages/core/contracts/interfaces/IReincarnationRights.sol - Created ReincarnationRights interface
packages/core/contracts/interfaces/IConfigurationManager.sol - Created ConfigurationManager interface
packages/test-framework/contracts/interfaces/IBaseDimension.sol - Created BaseDimension interface
`

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] Complete AlignmentRegistry implementation - Next Session - HIGH
- [ ] Implement SUTRAToken contract - Next Session - HIGH
- [ ] Create BaseDimension abstract contract - Next Session - MEDIUM
- [ ] Implement test case structure - Next Session - MEDIUM

### Upcoming Milestones

- Complete core contract implementations - Target: Session 003
- Implement dimension evaluators - Target: Session 005
- Connect test framework to rewards - Target: Session 007

## Open Issues

### Technical Questions

1. **Test Case Storage**
   - Context: Need to determine the best approach for storing test scenarios
   - Options: On-chain storage, IPFS, centralized database with hash verification
   - Current thinking: Use IPFS for scenario content with on-chain hash verification

2. **Upgradeability Strategy**
   - Context: Need to determine approach for contract upgrades
   - Options: Proxy pattern, migration pattern, immutable contracts
   - Current thinking: Use transparent proxy pattern for core contracts

## Resources

- SUTRA 3.1 codebase
- Alignment framework document
- OpenZeppelin contract documentation

## Notes for Next Session

The next session should focus on implementing the AlignmentRegistry contract following the interface defined in IAlignmentRegistry.sol. This is a foundational component that other parts of the system will depend on.
